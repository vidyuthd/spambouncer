        <button class="sb-faq-question">4. Why do I need to register for DND with TRAI?</button>
        <div class="sb-faq-answer-container">
          <p class="sb-faq-answer">You can choose not to register for DND, its purely your own choice. Registering for DND will allow TRAI to send your preference to your telecom operator to avoid Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC)/ Telemarketing Calls / SMS. Once your DND preference is set, all telemarketers are required to obey your preferences within 7 days of their being set</p>

        <button class="sb-faq-question">5. What is the difference between Spam Bouncer and other Spam Filtering Apps?</button>
        <div class="sb-faq-answer-container">
          <p class="sb-faq-answer">Most other Spam filtering apps use keyword or rulebased filtering. This is very tedious because the user needs to configure keywords and rules. This is not a scalable process as the user has to keep on updating with new keywords/rules, this is where Machine Learning comes in, it simplies the process by automating the process of predicting whether an app is SPAM or not. Very few apps use machine learning and not all can guarantee Security & Privacy, as they would need to send the incoming message/text to their server to add to their collection to improve the accuracy of filtering. Spam Bouncer uses real word messages collected from people who willingly contributed their messages as sample set to train Machine Learning models. Spam Bouncer does not use data from the app in any way whether it is keywords added or preferences saved. Everything stays on device with the user. Spam Bouncer has an amazing and intutive User Interface for the user to get started off very easily and also has lots of functionality bundled in it, like reporting SPAM message, configuring or managing keywords, iCloud Sync and registering for DND.</p>

        <button class="sb-faq-question">6. What is Deny list?</button>
        <div class="sb-faq-answer-container">
          <p class="sb-faq-answer">This is a list of all words used for determining whether an SMS should be filtered or not. If the incoming message/text contains any word which is present in this list, it would be marked as SPAM always, regardless what Machine Learning prediction is. This gives user more control for super user.</p>

      </li>
      <li class="sb-faq-list-item">
        <button class="sb-faq-question">7. What is Allow List?</button>
        <div class="sb-faq-answer-container">
          <p class="sb-faq-answer">This is the opposite of Deny list, a list of all words used for determining whether an SMS should be allowed or not. If the incoming message/text contains any word which is present in this list, it would not be marked as SPAM ever, regardless what Machine Learning prediction is. This gives user more control for super user.</p>

      <li class="sb-faq-list-item">
        <button class="sb-faq-question">8. What does disabling a a word in the list do and how to do it?</button>
        <div class="sb-faq-answer-container">
          <p class="sb-faq-answer">Disabling a word in the list(allow/deny) will make the filtering logic ignore that word. In other filtering logic behaves normally as if the word is not in the list and if the word is not present in the incoming message/text to be filtering using trained model for prediction (generated by Machine learning) would be applied for prediction purpose. For disabling a word in the list</p>

            <li class="sb-faq-sub-list-item">Open Spam Bouncer app</li>

        <button class="sb-faq-question">9. What does delete word from the list do?</button>
        <div class="sb-faq-answer-container">
          <p class="sb-faq-answer">Delete word from list removes the word from the list so that app will continue to predict whether the incoming message is spam or not using normal mode which is by using model(trained by Machine Learning).</p>
